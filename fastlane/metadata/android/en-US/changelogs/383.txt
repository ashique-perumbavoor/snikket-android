Voice and video calls are here! Now you can communicate with your friends
and family like it's 2019 again... face to (virtual) face.

For the calling feature to work, both you and your contact must be using
the latest version of the Snikket app (or other compatible software) and
you'll need the latest version of the Snikket service running.

Also included in this release:

  - Add PDF preview support (available on Android 5+)
  - Support for theme switching on Android 10
  - Fix profile picture selection on some Android 10 devices
